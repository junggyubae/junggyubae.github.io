## About me

Hello! I am a junior student of [ECE](https://ece.snu.ac.kr/en) at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html). I aim to use technology to drive real-world improvements in everyday life.

I am currently an intern at [HodooAI](https://hodooai.com) advised by professor [Jung Woo Lee](https://ece.snu.ac.kr/en/research-faculty/faculty/fulltime?md=view&profid=p057).

## Interests

I am interested in two main areas: **education** and **spatial design**.

In education, my interest lies in exploring **how to learn more efficiently** and **how to ask the right questions**. To further these goals, I have participated in various education-related projects, including [Digital Business Class](https://junggyubae.github.io/2024-01-21-Digital-Business-Class/), and I am particularly interested in leveraging technologies like HCI to enhance the learning experience.

In spatial design, my focus is on **how to use spaces more effectively**. Seoul, in particular, faces challenges due to urban concentration, and I aim to address this by optimizing the use of limited space and designing environments that are tailored to usersâ€™ needs. As part of this work, I have been studying 3D technology and have contributed to projects like [Reconstructing real world scene and objects with 3DGS and OpenGL](https://junggyubae.github.io/2024-11-11-Scene-Reconstruction/) to apply my research in practical, real-world settings.

My current focus is on **education** these days.
