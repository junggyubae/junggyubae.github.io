## About me

Hello! I am a junior student of [ECE](https://ece.snu.ac.kr/en) at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html). I am interested in using technology to drive real-world improvements in everyday life.

I am currently researching Optimization for Machine Learning at [CORE Lab](http://coregroup.snu.ac.kr), focusing on developing efficient algorithms to enhance model performance and computational efficiency. My work involves exploring various optimization techniques to improve generalization, convergence speed, and training stability in machine learning models, with the goal of making them more scalable and robust in real-world applications.

The problem I am most interested in these days are **education** and **spacial design**.
In the field of education, I am exploring ways to effectively convey the values I consider important. Specifically, I focus on **how to learn quickly** and **how to ask the right questions**. To achieve this, I have been involved in various education-related projects, such as [Digital Business Class](https://junggyubae.github.io/2024-01-21-Digital-Business-Class/), and I am currently interested in leveraging technologies like HCI to enhance the learning experience.
In the field of spatial design, I am interested in **how we can utilize spaces more efficiently**. In particular, Seoul faces a problem of urban concentration, and I aim to address this by optimizing the use of limited space and designing environments that cater to users' specific needs. To address this challenge, I have been studying 3D technology and have worked on projects like [Reconstructing real world scene and objects with 3DGS and OpenGL](https://junggyubae.github.io/2024-11-11-Scene-Reconstruction/) to apply my learning in practical ways.
