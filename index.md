## About me

Hello! I am a junior student of [ECE](https://ece.snu.ac.kr/en) at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html). I aim to use technology to drive real-world improvements in everyday life.

I am currently researching Optimization for Machine Learning at [CORE Lab](http://coregroup.snu.ac.kr), with a focus on developing efficient algorithms to improve model performance and computational efficiency. My goal is to enhance the scalability and robustness of algorithms in real-world applications. This involves exploring various optimization techniques to boost generalization and accelerate convergence in machine learning models.

## Interests

I am currently focused on two main areas: **education** and **spatial design**.

In education, my interest lies in exploring **how to learn more efficiently** and **how to ask the right questions**. To further these goals, I have participated in various education-related projects, including [Digital Business Class](https://junggyubae.github.io/2024-01-21-Digital-Business-Class/), and I am particularly interested in leveraging technologies like HCI to enhance the learning experience.

In spatial design, my focus is on how to use spaces more effectively. Seoul, in particular, faces challenges due to urban concentration, and I aim to address this by optimizing the use of limited space and designing environments that are tailored to usersâ€™ needs. As part of this work, I have been studying 3D technology and have contributed to projects like [Reconstructing real world scene and objects with 3DGS and OpenGL](https://junggyubae.github.io/2024-11-11-Scene-Reconstruction/) to apply my research in practical, real-world settings.
