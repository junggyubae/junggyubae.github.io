From January 19th to 28th, our 'Shahabat' team visited Lombok, Indonesia, to carry out a volunteer program that we had been preparing for three months.

We primarily conducted Korean Language Education and Digital Business Education for unemployed students in Lombok. I was in part of the Digital Business Education team and held related sessions. 

Our Digital Business team led design thinking workshops for Indonesian students, introducing innovative problem-solving methodologies tailored to digital business challenges. Additionally, we applied prototyping techniques to develop and test solutions aimed at improving local employment and fostering entrepreneurship.
