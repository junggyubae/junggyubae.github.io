subtitle: Graphics Programming Final Project
---

As a final project for [Graphics Programming (2024 Fall)](https://3d.snu.ac.kr/class/graphics24) class, we reconstructed real world scenes and objects using graphics programming methods.

We used, Blender, 3D Gaussian Splatting, Acceleration Techniques, Ambient Occlusion and Shadows to construct realistic scenes.

Here is the result:
